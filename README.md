# Λrchitect

Λrchitect is a simpler and quicker option for game composers who are looking to prototype their dynamic audio.  Setting up a Wwise or FMOD project just for the sake of prototyping can take awhile, and Λrchitect allows the user to simply upload their tracks, set the type of interactivity, and create a public link for easy shareability.
